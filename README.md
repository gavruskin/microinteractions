# Microinteractions
### Computational pipeline for fitting linear regression model for interaction coefficients inference.

Please check out first [this notebook](https://github.com/gavruskin/microinteractions/blob/master/taylor_lin_fit.ipynb).
The results of the analysis are summarized there, so may be you don't need to run your own analysis.
If you do, please follow the steps below.

## Pipeline

- The data file is assumed to be in the format as of Feb 21 and in the root folder.
- To generate the data file required for the model, run `python data_preprocess.py`
- To run the analysis: `python taylor_lin_fit.py`
