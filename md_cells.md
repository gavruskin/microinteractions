## Microinteractions
### Computational pipeline for fitting linear regression model for interaction coefficients inference.

The pre-release version of this pipeline assume the data to be in a very specific format.
Please contact alex@gavruskin.com if you wish to give it a try.

- Read the data and fit the model:

- Output summary statistics, for both development time and fitness:

- Plot inferred coefficients with confidence intervals:

- Jitter the data to add some variance:

- Fit the model and plot the results for jittered data:

- Output summary stats for jittered data:

- Plot parameters inferred from fitness:
